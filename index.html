            <h2 id="aboutme">About Me</h2>
                <p>My birthdate is January 11th, 2015. I was born in the Clovis Community hospital, 
                Fresno California. My hobbies are to play Clash of Clans. My other hobbies are playing 
                sports: football, baseball basketball, and wrestling. I am currently in 
                wrestling right now. I have four sisters, and two brothers. My moms name is Deven, 
                and my dads name is Antonio.</p>
            <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
                <p>My dream vacation is to go to the Caribbean. I would make sure I have a lot of 
                money to spend. Somewhere I would like to go one day would be my Cousin Carlos’s 
                house in Canada. That is where he lives. Sometimes some of my aunts and uncles would 
                go and visit without me.</p>
                <h3>Long term goals</h3>
                    <p>My long term goal is to graduate high school with a G.P.A. higher than a 4.0. 
                    I want to get Valedictorian that would make me the first grandchild to do so on 
                    my dad side of the family. It would also make me feel ready for college, or if I get 
                    a scholarship because of my grades that would be really helpful. I am really doing this 
                    for my future with my siblings, I really want to be able to be there for them as a big 
                    brother should be.</p>
                <h3>Short term goals</h3>
                    <p>I want to finish Soft more year with a 4.0 for 1st and 2nd semester. I am confident 
                    about my first semester, because I already have a 4.0 as of right now. I just really 
                    want to make my mom and dad very proud of me, and just have the pride in myself. 
                    It just makes me feel better as a person. I kind of have another short term goal, 
                    which would be having to do with weightlifting. I want to get stronger, and have 
                    more muscle mass. I would also say by the end of this school year. </p>
            <h2 id="accomplishments">Accomplishments</h2>
                <h3>Educational</h3>
                    <p>I would say I have multiple educational accomplishments. They would be: in the 
                    6th grade, I received a plaque awarding me “Student of the Year”, also I received 
                    honor roll all four quarters, freshman year at Bullard High School. I take pride 
                    in these awards because not many teenagers can say this themselves. </p>
                <h3>Personal</h3>
